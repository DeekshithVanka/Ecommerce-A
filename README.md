Project setup: 
1. Backend
2. Frontend

   1.Backend involves server(using nodejs and expressjs),database(mongodb)<br>
   Challanges<br>
   
  (a) CORS issue<br>
   This issue is arised when connecting backend and front end due to browsers policy of not sharing others website information<br>
   It is solve by using cors function provide by express js<br>
   
  (b) Sever Restart issue<br>
   whenver any updates are made in server code we need to run the code again<br>
   To avoid that i have installed a package called nodemon<br>
   
   (c)  node modules issue<br>
   First push of code involving node modules is a big task where this can be downloaded by the package.json<br>
   .gitignore is used<br><br>
   
   2.Frontend issues
   (a) Product pages issue<br>
   whenever the user clicks on the product a new page should open where building each for all products is tideous task<br>
   so whenever product id of the product is extracted and it is dyanamically fetched from the backend<br>
   
   (b)  Responsive issue<br>
   NO adaption of the website according to size of the screen is big draw back<br>
   Usage of the relative units like rem ,vh ,vw,em and flexbox is used  commonly<br>
